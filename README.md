# Search Engine for Natural Language Processing System
Developed a robust search engine to process and query a corpus of documents.
Engineered a custom dictionary data structure using advanced techniques like Red-Black Trees and Hash Tables to efficiently count and store word occurrences.
Implemented a dynamic pattern search mechanism capable of identifying patterns starting or ending mid-word, leveraging algorithms like Rabin-Karp and Tries for high accuracy and efficiency.
Achieved superior performance in search results compared to baseline implementations, focusing on runtime optimization and competitive performance benchmarks.
Designed and tested functionality to handle large datasets, ensuring correctness, scalability, and optimized runtime for various test cases.
